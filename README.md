## 🧩 How It Works

### 1. Select Players  
User picks 11 players → proceeds to Captain selection.

- Cannot choose the same player as both C & VC.  
- Must pick both before saving.

### 3. Save Team  
Selected team is saved and displayed under **My Teams**.


### 4. View / Edit Team
Team Preview button shows full team in a modal.
Edit icon returns the user to the player selection page.
